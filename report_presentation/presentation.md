# Slide 3: Initial Data Scraping
## Data Collection Strategy

- Used arxiv API to scrape paper metadata
- Collected 5,000 papers per category
- Data fields: title, abstract, authors, categories, publication date, comments

## Category Mapping

- Papers mapped to 8 major fields:
  - Physics
  - Mathematics
  - Computer Science 
  - Quantitative Biology
  - Quantitative Finance
  - Statistics
  - Electrical Engineering and Systems Science
  - Economics

## Dataset Split

- Train/Val/Test: 63/27/10
- Stratified sampling to preserve class distribution
- Automated data quality checks for missing values
